    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Zucchini Crust Pizza is the BEST low carb recipe to make with fresh garden zucchini and your favorite pizza toppings. This recipe works well with almond flour, all-purpose flour, and coconut flour.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
                <li>2 cups shredded zucchini</li>
                <li>¼ tsp Salt</li>
                <li>3 large eggs beaten</li>
                <li>½ cup all-purpose flour see notes</li>
                <li>1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1/3 cup pizza or marinara sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>12 slices pepperoni</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°.</li>
        <li>Spread the shredded zucchini out on a lightly greased baking sheet and sprinkle lightly with salt. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove and transfer the zucchini to paper towels or a cheesecloth.</li>
        <li>Increase oven temperature to 450°.</li>
        <li>Squeeze out as much additional moisture from the zucchini as possible. Add the zucchini to a large bowl along with the whisked eggs.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the flour in gradually, stirring to incorporate. Continue to add flour until desired consistency is obtained. (I use the entire ½ cup for all-purpose flour.)</li>
        <li>Spread out onto a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan, leaving 1-inch or so around the edges. Use a fork to gently poke holes in the dough to prevent the crust from bubbling up as it bakes.</li>
        <li>Top with shredded Parmesan cheese and bake for 18 minutes, until it begins to brown slightly. Remove from oven.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to 400°.</li>
        <li>If possible, let the crust cool for extra crispy results.</li>
        <li>Top with pizza sauce, mozzarella cheese, and pepperoni (or desired pizza toppings). Bake for 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Top with parsley, red pepper flakes, and/or grated Parmesan cheese and serve!</li>
        </ol>
