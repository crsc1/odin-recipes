                2 cups broccoli cut into bite-sized pieces
                1 yellow onion cut into chunks

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <h2>Prep Work</h2>
            <ol>
                Combine the sauce ingredients in a large measuring cup with a spout. Transfer ¼ cup of it to a medium bowl and set the rest aside.
                Place plastic wrap over the beef and use a meat tenderizer to pound it on each side. This makes it much more tender. Cut away any large areas of fat.
                Slice the meat into strips (against the grain). Cut the strips into smaller pieces, about 1.5 inches long.
                Season the beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Transfer it to the reserved ¼ cup of sauce and toss to coat. Let it marinate while you cut the vegetables and begin boiling salted water for the Lo Mein.   
            </ol>
        
            <h2>Make the Stir Fry</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Once all ingredients are measured and ready, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and let it sear, undisturbed, for 2-3 minutes. Toss and allow the other sides to cook through, about 2 more minutes. Remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat off and add the wine. Set the heat to medium and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the skillet, this will add flavor to the sauce. Let it bubble and reduce by half, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Boil the noodles for 1 minute less than al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Drain once cooked. (Optional, drizzle with a little oil and toss to coat.)</li>
                <li>While the noodles cook, add the vegetables to the skillet with the wine and cook for about 3 minutes to soften slightly.</li>
                <li>Add the sauce and bring it to a boil to activate the cornstarch and thicken the sauce. Once thickened, reduce heat to low.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked noodles a bit at a time, tossing to coat until desired noodle-to-sauce- ratio is obtained. The noodles will continue to absorb the sauce and the flavors will continue to meld as it stands.</li>
                <li>Add the beef back along with any juices from the plate and toss to coat. Heat through for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Garnish with green onions and serve!</li>
            </ol>
